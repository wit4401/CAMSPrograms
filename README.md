# CAMS Project
## What is C.A.M.S.?
CAMS stands for Center of Applied Mathematics & Sciences which allow students to undertake a real world project and apply their Mathematics and Computer Science studies to solve it. The project created a great chance to showcase what I have learned as a Computer Science and Mathematics Dual Major at Salisbury University showcasing my skills as a programmer and data analyst. I was able apply techniques of regression analysis, clustering, data summation, and ... to solve a real world problem.
## Introduction
Our group in this project was assigned to analyze data pertaining to college students eating habits and their social environment. Topics like calorie consumption based on location and who students eat with, macronutrients beyond calories based on environment of eating place, the impact of mental health and consumption of food in certain environments, and many others. This project was done for Pass/Fail credit during Spring 2023 and was a group effort of the whole class, but this repository contains the work I accomplished during the duration of this project.
